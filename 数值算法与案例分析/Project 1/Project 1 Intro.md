# Project 1 Intro

## Requirements

Project 1 for this courese this year requires the implementation of Francis double shift strategy designed for Schur composition on real matrices. 
An alternative choice is to implement the AED (Aggressive Early Deflation) on complex matrices. No collaboration is permitted and helpful inputs
from peers shall be acknowledged.

I have taken the former, the Francis double shift strategy.

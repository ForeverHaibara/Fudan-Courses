# Project 2

## Requirements

Project 2 of the course is the final one. One can work with any topic he or she takes interest in without collaboration.
Topics on real-world examples, large sparse matrix in particular, are prefered.

I have chosen the topic of locally linear embedding, a dimension reduction algorithm where sparse matrix computation is included.

    "2. The person wakes up with headache on the second day.\n",

    "However, there is a non-negligible probability that the person gets drunk in the first, sleeps with shoes and catches a headache the next day. So in the real world we will observe that \"a with-shoe sleeper\" is highly likely to \"wake up with headache\". This is known as the association.\n",

    "\n",
    "For each $\\omega_i$, if $A(\\omega_i)=1$, indicating it has received the treatment, we denote $Y_i^1 = Y_i$ to be the outcome. And we denote $Y_i^0$ to be the potential outcome <font color=red>had it not received</font> the new treatment.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "$${\\rm SACE}\\stackrel{?}{=}\\mathbb P(Y|A=1) - \\mathbb P(Y|A=0)\\quad\\quad(\\star).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The plug-in estimator gives the aforementioned formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widehat{\\rm SACE}=\\frac{1}{n_1}\\sum_{A_i=1}Y_i^1 - \\frac{1}{n_0}\\sum_{A_i=0}Y_i^0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet we need four assumptions (conditions) for ($\\star$) and its plug-in estimator to hold: consistency, stable unit treatment value assumption, exchangeability and positivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all four conditions are satisfied, we say that the ACE is identifiable in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "Consistency is the definition of $Y_i^{A_i}$: i.e. $Y_i^1=Y_i$ if $A_i=1$ while $Y_i^0=Y_i$ if $A_i=0$. Jointly,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y_i = A_iY_i^1+(1-A_i)Y_i^0.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption\n",
    "\n",
    "Stable unit treatment value assumption (SUTVA) requires no interference between subjects, so that the distribution of $Y_i$ given $A_1,\\dotsc,A_n$ is equal to that given merely $A_i$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb P(Y_i|A_1,\\dotsc,A_n) \\equiv \\mathbb P(Y_i|A_i).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exchangeability\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from the attribute $A$, there are other **confounding** variables $C$ that have impacts on the outcome. We need to control such variables so that the treatment group and controlled group are identical in these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve so, we assign the value of $A_i$ (decide whether a subject should be in the treatment group before the experiment starts) with $0$ or $1$ with equal probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb P(A=1|C=c)=\\mathbb P(A=0|C=c)=\\frac12.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also called the assumption of unconfoundness or randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, the exchangeability leads to \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb E(Y^1|A=1) =\\mathbb E(Y^1|A=0)\\quad{\\rm and}\\quad \\mathbb E(Y^0|A=1)=\\mathbb E(Y^0|A=0).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This indicates that: if the subjects in the controlled group had received the new treatment, they should react the same as the current treatment group.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, $\\mathbb P$ is a product measure over $A\\times C$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Positivity\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $C=c$, we need $\\mathbb P(A=0|C=c)>0$ and $\\mathbb P(A=1|C=c)>0$. This assumption automatically holds when the exchangeability holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ACE\n",
    "\n",
    "**Theorem** When the four assumptions hold, ${\\rm ACE} = \\mathbb E(Y^1) -\\mathbb E(Y^0) = \\mathbb E(Y|A=1) -\\mathbb E(Y|A=0)$. Also, assuming the confounding variable $C$ is categorical we have \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbb E(Y^a) =\\sum_c \\mathbb E(Y|A=a, \\ C=c)\\mathbb P(C = c).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Proof** For the first equation, note that the exchangeability implies $\\mathbb E(Y^1|A=1) =\\mathbb E(Y^1|A=0)=\\mathbb E(Y^1)$ and also $\\mathbb E(Y^0|A=0) = \\mathbb E(Y^0)$. Therefore,\n",

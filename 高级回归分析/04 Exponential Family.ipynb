    "Parametric family is a set of probability measure $\\mathbb P_\\theta$ on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal F)$ with each indexed by a paramter $\\theta\\in \\Theta\\subset \\mathbb R^d$. The $\\Theta$ is called the parameter space while $d$ is the dimension.\n",

    "\n",
    "A parametric family $\\{\\mathbb P_{\\theta}:\\ \\theta\\in\\Theta\\}$ dominated by a $\\sigma$-finite measure $\\nu$ on $(\\Omega,\\mathcal F)$ is called an exponential family if and only if it takes the form\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{d \\mathbb P_\\theta}{d\\nu}(\\omega) = h(\\omega) \\exp\\left\\{\\eta(\\theta)^TT(w) - \\xi(\\theta)\\right\\}\\quad\\quad  \\omega\\in\\Omega\\quad\\quad\\quad (\\star)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $T(\\omega)$ is a random $p$-vector and $h(\\omega)$ is a nonnegative random variable independent with $\\theta$. Function $\\eta(\\theta):\\ \\Theta\\rightarrow \\mathbb R^p$, while $\\xi(\\theta)$ is a scaling factor that ensures  $\\int_{\\Omega} \\frac{d \\mathbb P_\\theta}{d\\nu}d\\nu = 1$.\n",

    "<br>\n",

    "NOTE: The form in definition $(\\star)$ is not unique (for instance we can multiply $h(\\omega)$ by a constant while adding the logarithm of the constant to the scaling factor $\\xi(\\theta)$).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Canonical Form\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the variable, $\\eta = \\eta(\\theta)$ so that $\\eta\\in \\{\\eta(\\theta):\\ \\theta\\in\\Theta\\}$. Now the exponential family has parameter $\\eta$ and is equivalent to the following form\n",
